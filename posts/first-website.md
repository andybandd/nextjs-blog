Everyone has to start somewhere I guess and my first website seems like it should be that somewhere. The first thing I did was to purchase this domain and email hosting and I figured that, before reaching the dizzying height of programming blockchains, I should probably learn some **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascipt**, build a webite and use it to showcase my God-given coding skills

I browsed the net for some tutorials and eventually found Ania Kubow's 12 hour coding bootcamp video on YouTube which I believe is now approaching a million views. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm4BObh4MhI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm4BObh4MhI).  I am not surprised. I learned so much from that as well being to steal the template for the bio site that she built in the process. 

I promise Ania that I will adapt it to my own style very soon and Thank you so much. You are a great teacher.

So I was able to cobble this site together and get it out there. I didn't want to use something like Wordpress as I felt it important to be as close to the code as possible if that makes any sense

I suppose down the line I will use this website to showcase that I can understand important concepts in this sector and, more importantly, that I can build and deploy useful applications. There is so much to look into and I am keen to get stuck in. I am thinking of getting a blog up and running on here next. (Yes I know. You won't see this post until the blog is up and running. Weird but it is what it is,).

I know initially that I will not be writing original code from scratch and that I will be borrowing code from others and adapting it but the idea is that, futher down the line, I can unlock some kind of currently dormant creative spark and do at least some original work.

My path is not clear at all. So much stuff out there but I have some ideas at this stage. I am not going to be working for the big boys. Thats clear. So at least I can stay clear of DevOps. Phew! I don't really want to specialise in one particular area. Not sure if thats an option if I am to make any money out of coding. anyway thats some time off. I'm thinking maybe App development long term ?

So I'm now getting deeper into Javacript, Node JS and the frameworks. The blog is going to be a Next JS React project and I need to look at other pacjages in the various JS stacks. I have dipped my toe into Python, PHP for this website and also some SQL. Need to get stuck depper into databases and APIs too. I have an idea for a restaurant app that would teach me a lot I think.

I have also just bought my first Apple Mac. So I need to get up to speed on that quickly.

Anyway. Thats enough for now I think. Next one (and this one) will be uploaded when the blog is up and running,

Thank you for reading this nonsense.
