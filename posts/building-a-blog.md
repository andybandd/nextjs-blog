I finally got my blog working over the weekend. Again nothing original here. I followed a tutorial on deploying a NextJS project on the Vercel platform which was a simple blog. Just what I needed. Once deployed on the Vercel platform I just created a link to it from my own website. Its not fancy but it works and a big thank you to the guys @Vercel for the tutorial and ability to deploy the project. I learned an awful lot in the process which wasn’t smooth but, as I’m sure you all know,  and I’m beginning to realise, nothing in this space is ever smooth.

The other thing that I started to get to grips with during this process was Github. I had already opened an account but didn’t really have a clue how to use the site. Things were much clearer after completing this project. I was creating repositories, cloning them and at the end feeling confident enough to make them public. So thanks again to the folks @Vercel for that.

One thing I am still very conscious of is that I am still basically copying code. The level of abstraction involved in using NextJS reminded me that I am still not as familiar as I should be with Vanilla Javascriot and I should put more hours into the basics before getting too familiar with the React library and the NextJS framework and others that I will no doubt encounter soon. I do intend though to deepen my understanding of this whole area of coding over the next few weeks. I get the feeling that it is, for me, an important foundation stone to have before delving into the wider coding environment. I am advised that websites are old hat and Apps is where it’s at. Nevertheless, as an introduction to coding and this industry in general I’m happy to have started with this.

So much to learn. ‘I’ll catch ya at the next one’. @beardmeatsfood
